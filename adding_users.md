# Adding users

This quick start guide is the short version of parts of the [ownCloud User management guide](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.4/admin_manual/configuration/user/user_configuration.html).

To create a user account:

1. Open the administrator user interface. The default view of the interface shows the users. 
2. In the upper part of the screen, enter the new userâ€™s login name and e-mail address.  
    **Note:** Login names can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), dashes (-), underscores (_), periods (.) and at signs (@).
3. Optionally, select a group for the new user in the **Groups** drop-down menu.
4. Click **Create**.

After creating the user, you can fill in their Full Name if it is different than the login name, or leave it for the user to complete.
